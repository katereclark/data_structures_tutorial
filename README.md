# Data Structures Tutorial
Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Every programmer should understand these data structures and what they are capable of:

* [Stacks](https://github.com/katereclark/data_structures_tutorial/edit/main/stacks.md)
* [Sets](https://github.com/katereclark/data_structures_tutorial/edit/main/sets.md)
* [Trees](https://github.com/katereclark/data_structures_tutorial/edit/main/trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
