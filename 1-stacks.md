# Stacks

## Introduction and Uses

What is the purpose of the data structure?

What is the performance of the data structure (you will need to talk about big O notation)?

What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?

How would the data structure be used in Python (in some cases you will need to discuss recursion)?

What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?

## Important Concepts

`docking_steps = ["4. Connect spaceship port to docking platform", "2. Line up with space station docking platform", "1. Maintain orbit with space station", "5. Engage locking mechanisms", 6. Depressurize docking bay", "3. Engage thrusters"]`

## Efficiency

## Example Problem
After traveling for weeks the space station has finally come into sight! Man, if we mess up the docking phase... Well, let's just make sure that we don't. Good thing we made that list of spaceship docking steps! Now, how could we be sure that they would come out in the right order so we don't expload our new ship? We need a data structure that is ordered and lets us take out the information in a certain order. A stack should do the trick!

We will start with an empty list (stack) to create a docking procedure with.

`docking_procedure = []`

## Problem to Solve
spaceship launch codes - boss told you that he wants you to use the most recent one that was created and put in. how can we know which one that was?
