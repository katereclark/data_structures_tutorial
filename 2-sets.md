# Sets

## Introduction and Uses

What is the purpose of the data structure?

What is the performance of the data structure (you will need to talk about big O notation)?

What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?

How would the data structure be used in Python (in some cases you will need to discuss recursion)?

What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?

## Important Concepts

## Efficiency

| Set Operation | Code | Performance | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Add | set.add(value) | O(1) | Add value to end of set |
| Remove | set.remove(value) | O(1) | Remove value from set |
| Size | length = len(set) | O(1) | Size of set |
| Member | if value in set: | O(1) | Check if value is in set |
