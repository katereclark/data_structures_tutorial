# Sets

## Introduction and Uses

A set is a data structure where the order of the items inside is not important and each item in the set must be unique. This means that a set cannot contain duplicates and is very efficient when it comes to determining whether an item is in the set. The O(1) efficiency of operations in a set is due to hashing. Hashing maps an item in the set to a specific index location through a function that converts the item's value into an index number. As an example of this, 

What is the purpose of the data structure?
What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?
How would the data structure be used in Python (in some cases you will need to discuss recursion)?
What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?

## Important Concepts

## Efficiency

| Set Operation | Code | Performance | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Add | set.add(value) | O(1) | Add value to end of set |
| Remove | set.remove(value) | O(1) | Remove value from set |
| Size | length = len(set) | O(1) | Size of set |
| Member | if value in set: | O(1) | Check if value is in set |
