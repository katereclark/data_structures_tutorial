## Introduction and Uses

What is the purpose of the data structure?

What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?

What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?

## Recursion

How would the data structure be used in Python (in some cases you will need to discuss recursion)?

## Important Concepts

## Efficiency

| Set Operation | Code | Performance | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| New Set | set = set() | O(1) | Create empty set |
| Add | set.add(value) | O(1) | Add value to set |
| Remove | set.remove(value) | O(1) | Remove value from set |
| Size | length = len(set) | O(1) | Size of set |
| Member | if value in set: | O(1) | Check if value is in set | 

## Example Problem

sort or search through aliens that brought back by their names, size, etc

## Problem to Solve

space ship capacity to carry them all back to see if have enough space and what ship model would have the capacity to carry them all back
